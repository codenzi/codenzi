            <h1>Smart Archive Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 24, 2025</p>

            <p>This privacy policy describes our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the <strong>Smart Archive</strong> ("Application") mobile application, provided by <strong>Baki Tunçer</strong> (Publisher Name: <strong>Codenzi Labs</strong>) ("we", "us", or "our").</p>
            <p>By using our Application, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>The primary purpose of our Application is to store your files securely and privately. Accordingly, the types of information we collect are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Provided by You:</strong> For the Application to perform its core function, we collect and store the files (e.g., PDF documents, images, text files, etc.) that you choose to send via the "Share" menu from other applications. This action is entirely under your control.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatically Collected Technical Data:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>File Metadata:</strong> To help you manage your archive, we process metadata of the stored files, such as their name, size, and date.</li>
                        <li><strong>File Hash Values:</strong> To prevent you from creating multiple copies of the same file, we generate and store a cryptographic summary (MD5 hash) from the content of the stored files. This summary cannot be used to restore the original file content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Application Preferences:</strong> We store settings you choose on your device to personalize your in-app experience, such as the selected theme (Light/Dark/System).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Collected by Third-Party Services (Advertising and Analytics):</strong> Our Application may use advertising and analytics services to maintain and improve our services.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We may use the Google AdMob service to display ads within the Application. AdMob may collect your device's Advertising ID, IP address, and other technical information about your device to serve you more relevant ads. For more information on how Google uses data, please visit the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Ad Policy</a> page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> We may use analytics tools like Google Analytics for Firebase to understand application performance and improve the user experience. These tools may collect anonymized data about how the application is used (e.g., which features are used how often, app crash reports, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide the core features of the Application: storing, listing, viewing, and managing your files.</li>
                <li>To personalize the user experience (e.g., applying your chosen theme).</li>
                <li>To use storage space efficiently by preventing the storage of duplicate files.</li>
                <li>To serve advertisements through our third-party advertising partners.</li>
                <li>To analyze usage statistics to identify bugs and improve performance in the Application.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p><strong>The privacy and security of your data are of the utmost importance to us.</strong></p>

                <li>None of your files, metadata, or personal information is uploaded, backed up, or transferred to a server on the internet by us or any third party. You are in complete control.</li>
                <li>For the security of your data, we rely on the standard security mechanisms provided by the Android operating system.</li>
